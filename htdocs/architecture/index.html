<H2>Threads and I/O Model</H2>

<P>
Distributor does not spawn a new thread for each connection.  That type
of architecture incurs a high context-switch rate (transitions between
kernel and user space) as the kernel switches between threads.  Instead,
Distributor has a small and fairly constant number of threads to handle
its various tasks.  The distribution algorithms, which are responsible
for selecting a back-end server for each client, use non-blocking I/O to
allow handling of multiple pending connections.  The bulk data transfer
for established connections is also done using non-blocking I/O in the
DataMover threads.  Having multiple threads allows distributor to take
advantage of multi-CPU systems, but limiting the number of threads to a
small number avoids the context-switch problems.

<P>
Here is a list of the threads in you're likely to see in a running copy
of Distributor.  You can list the threads in your copy with the
'threads' command available via the controller.

<UL>
<LI>main/Distributor: accepts incoming connections and hands them off to
    TargetSelector</LI>
<LI>TargetSelector:  Marshalls pending connections through the
    DistributionAlgorithms</LI>
<LI>DistributionAlgorithm (x # of algorithms):  Initiates connections to
    back-end servers</LI>
<LI>Controller:  accepts incoming control connections</LI>
<LI>ControllerConnection (x # of control connections)</LI>
<LI>ServiceTest:  Test targets</LI>
<LI>Target (x # of targets): Remove old connections</LI>
<LI>DataMover (x # of targets):  Data transfer</LI>
</UL>

<P>
And here is a diagram showing how these threads interact.
