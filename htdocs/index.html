<P>
Distributor is a software load balancer. Like other load balancers, it accepts
connections and distributes them to an array of back end servers.
Some of Distributor's more unique or advanced features:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Integrated testing of back end servers</LI>
<LI>Optional termination of client connections to misfunctioning servers</LI>
<LI>Online control of load balancer configuration</LI>
<LI>Grouping of servers with rollover from group to group</LI>
<LI>Two connection distribution methods:  round robin and hashed based on
  client IP address</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Service Testing</H2>

<P>
Distributor includes built-in support for testing the back end servers.
The basic operation of a load balancer is to attempt to make a TCP connection
to each back end server in turn until the load balancer finds a server it can
connect to.  This is done for each incoming client connection.  This is fine
for detecting gross failures like servers that are off, etc. but is
insufficient for detecting more subtle failures like overloaded servers that
accept a TCP connection but then immediately disconnect, or perhaps worse
accept the TCP connection but then never transmit any data or disconnect.
Or servers that are serving the wrong data for some reason.
</P>

<P>
To handle these types of situations, the load balancer needs to regular scan
the back end servers using a test that simulates a client request and ensure
that each of the servers is serving valid data.  Any server that isn't doing so
should cease to receive new connections until it is corrected.
</P>

<P>
Distributor includes just such a mechanism.  This testing can be as simple or
as complicated as you need.  Distributor uses a plugin mechanism to make it as
simple as possible to develop your own tests.  The tests can either be
developed as a Java class or an external application in any language you want
(shell script, Perl, C, etc.)  Distributor comes with an LDAP service test and
an HTTP service test will be next.
</P>

<H2>Client Disconnection</H2>

<P>
One possible failure mode mentioned earlier is a server that accepts a TCP
connection but then never transmits data or disconnects.  This could leave
clients stuck in a bad situation.  In some cases you may wish that the load
balancer would terminate all of the connections to a server when it detects
that the server is not serving valid data.  This might allow the clients to
reconnect to a functioning server, for example.  Distributor allows you to
enable this behavior if you desire.
</P>

<H2>Online Control</H2>

<P>
Distributor supports online (i.e. while it is running) control of certain
configurables (enabling/disabling servers, log levels, etc.) as well as
statistics reports.  Access is via a TCP port available only to localhost on
the machine running the load balancer[1].  Interactive control can be
accomplished via telnet and scripting is fairly easy using something like

</P>

<P>
[1] No, this isn't the most advanced security in the world.  However, you
probably shouldn't be using a box with untrusted users as a load balancer.
Code to implement some form of authentication would be welcome.
</P>

<H2>Grouping of Servers</H2>

<P>
You can group servers into multiple groups.  Distributor will distribute
connections to servers in the first group unless it detects that all of the
servers in that group are unavailable, then it will rollover to the servers in
the next group, etc.  This allows you to have backup servers that don't get
traffic until your primaries servers are down.
</P>

<H2>Connection Distribution Methods</H2>

<P>
Distributor offers two algorithms for distributing connections to back end
servers.  The default is round robin, distributor maintains a list of the
servers and just picks the next one in the list for each connection.  This
should maintain a fairly even load on the servers.
</P>

<P>
If your service requires that clients always get connected to the same back end
server you can choose the hash algorithm.  In this case distributor maintains a
hash table of client IP addresses and the server they were first connected to.
When a new connection from a client comes in distributor first tries to connect
the client to the same server it was connected to previously.  If that server
is down, or if the client hasn't connected before, distributor falls back to
the round robin algorithm.
