Quick guide to installing and running Distributor:

Install
-------

Presuming you want to install into /usr/local:

- cp distributor.conf /usr/local/etc/distributor.conf
- cp build/lib/distributor-x.x.jar /usr/local/lib/distributor-x.x.jar

- Edit distributor.conf, read README.distributor.conf for help
- Get Java 1.4.0 or greater.  Distributor uses many features that were
  introduced in Java 1.4.  http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html
  You can just get the JRE if all you want to do is run Distributor.  If
  you want the compiler, etc. get the SDK.

Run
---

If you've configured Distributor to listen on a privileged port (<1024)
then you'll need to run it as root.  Otherwise it can as any user.
distributor.init is a sample init script for starting Distributor at
boot time.

java -jar /usr/local/lib/distributor-x.x.jar /usr/local/etc/distributor.conf
